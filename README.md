## Overview

Welcome! This is CytoPlots, a small package of plotting utilities for use when analysing cytometry data in Python.
CytoPlots started as a module in the first release of <a src="https://github.com/burtonrj/CytoPy">CytoPy</a>.

CytoPlots is now a standalone package that provides functions and classes for:

* Biaxial cytometry plots with common transforms such as logicle and arcsinh
* Scatterplots intended for visualising high dimensional embeddings from tools like UMAP and tSNE
* Density plots
* Box and swarm plots with statistical annotations
* Other cool utilities like a convenient wrapper on the matplotlib Figure object
